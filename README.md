# 🐍 Python Data Structures – Basic Tasks

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate fundamental data structure concepts in Python.

The tasks focus on:
- Dictionaries
- List slicing
- User input handling
- Basic Python operations

---

## 📌 Task 1: Dictionary of Student Marks

### 📖 Description
This program:
- Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and marks are values.
- Prompts the user to enter a student's name.
- Displays the corresponding marks if found.
- Shows a message if the student is not found.

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- Dictionaries
- Key-value pairs
- `input()` function
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Dictionary lookup

---

## 📌 Task 2: List Slicing Demonstration

### 📖 Description
This program:
- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first five elements using slicing.
- Reverses the extracted elements.
- Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- Lists
- `range()` function
- List slicing
- Reverse slicing (`[::-1]`)
